# 🏇 Horse Race Program  

Welcome to the **Horse Race Program** — a Java application built for Semester 2 coursework! This project showcases the power of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **JavaFX** in creating a feature-rich and visually appealing application for managing and simulating horse races.  

---

## 📋 Overview  

The Horse Race Program allows users to:  
- **Register Horses**: Add, update, and view horse details effortlessly.  
- **Simulate Races**: Automatically rank horses and display race results visually.  
- **Data Persistence**: Save user inputs to a text file and retrieve them when needed.  

Built with maintainability and scalability in mind, this project uses industry best practices, such as error handling, unit testing, and modular design.

## 🎨 Features  

- **JavaFX GUI**: A sleek and intuitive interface designed for an engaging user experience, enhanced with **CSS styling**.  
- **OOP Concepts**: Full utilization of Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism for robust and maintainable code.  
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Bubble sort implementation to arrange horse IDs in ascending order.  
- **Error Handling**: User input validation with comprehensive error handling using `try-catch` blocks.  
- **Unit Testing**: Rigorous testing of classes and methods to ensure expected functionality.

## 🛠️ Key Functionalities  

1. **Horse Registration**:  
   - Add new horses with unique IDs.  
   - Update or delete existing horse details.  

2. **Race Simulation**:  
   - Select top horses based on category.  
   - Automatically rank and position horses based on race results.  
   - Display results visually using JavaFX.  

3. **Data Persistence**:  
   - Save horse details and race data in a text file.  
   - Retrieve saved data as needed.

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Start the Program**: Launch the GUI via the JavaFX interface.  
2. **Manage Horses**: Use intuitive forms to register, update, or view horse details.  
3. **Simulate Races**: Select horses and see their rankings based on race outcomes.  
4. **Visual Display**: Enjoy a clean and interactive visualization of race results.

## 🧪 Testing  

- **Unit Tests**: Each class and method is rigorously tested to ensure accurate functionality.  
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and exception handling for user inputs.  
- **Expected vs. Actual Outputs**: Verifications ensure alignment between desired and actual outcomes.  

---

## 🔍 Assumptions  

- All horse IDs are unique.  
- Bubble sorting is sufficient for sorting horse IDs due to limited data size.  

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements  

- Implement advanced race algorithms for realistic simulations.  
- Integrate a database for better scalability and data management.  
- Enhance GUI design with richer animations and themes.  
- Introduce multiplayer functionality for a competitive experience.
